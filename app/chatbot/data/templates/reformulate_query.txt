System: Here is a user question to be used for a search in a technical document database with a vector database:

"{user_question}"

If the question is already precise, informative, and targeted, return:
NO_REWRITE

Else, if the question is too vague, too broad, or not specific enough, return a reformulated version of the question that is more precise and informative.
The reformulated query should be clear, and focused on the specific information the user is seeking. It should not include words like "please", "discuss" etc.

Eventually use context to replace unknown pronoums. DO NOT use context to add information into the query NOR answer the question.
Context : {context}

Reminder: the question to rewrite is "{user_question}", and you should NOT answer the question but REWRITE it into a query.
